            Benefits of Understanding Emotions
        </h1>

        <main>
        
           
            <p> As discussed, emotions have helped humans evolve and survive. 
                According to  <a href="#footer" class="word">Ekman</a><sup>1</sup>, who developed the wheel of emotion, “It would be very dangerous if we didn’t have emotions. It would also be a very dull life. 
                Because, basically, our emotions drive us — excitement, pleasure, even anger.” That is why it’s important that we’re able to understand emotions as they play such an important role in how we behave.
                <br>
                <br>
                Ekman argues that emotions are fundamentally constructive. 
                They are influenced by what is good for our species overall and what we learned during our upbringing. 
                They guide our behavior in a way that should lead us to a positive outcome. However, emotions can become destructive if the emotions we’ve learned are the correct response no longer fit our situation, or if subconscious emotions cause reactions that we are unable to understand. 
                Being in touch with your emotions and turning your understanding into action is called emotional awareness. Being able to do this with others as well is referred to as emotional intelligence.
                <br>
                <br>
                Emotional intelligence is the ability to perceive, control and evaluate emotions. The term was first coined by researchers Peter Salovey and John D. Mayer and found popularity through Dan Goleman’s 1996 book. They define it as the ability to recognize, understand and manage our own emotions as well as recognize, understand and influence those of others. 
                The study of <a href="#footer" class="word">emotional intelligence</a><sup>2</sup> has gained much popularity since the mid-1990s, with business professionals, relationship coaches and more using the term to encourage others to improve their lives. 
                Many researchers believe that emotional intelligence can be improved over time, while some argue that it’s a trait we’re born with or without.
                <br>
                <br>
                The components of emotional intelligence include:</p>
                <ul>
                <li>Appraising and expressing emotions in the self and others: Recognizing or expressing verbal or nonverbal cues about emotion.</li>
                <li>Regulating emotion in the self and others: Managing emotions so that all parties are motivated towards a positive outcome.</li>
                <li>Using emotions in adaptive ways: Using emotion and the interpretation of emotions to result in positive outcomes.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                Those who have emotional intelligence open themselves to positive and negative emotional experiences, identify the emotions and communicate those emotions appropriately. 
                Emotionally intelligent people can use their understanding of their emotions and the emotions of others to move toward personal and <a href="#footer" class="word">social growth</a><sup>3</sup>. Those with low emotional intelligence may unable to understand and control their emotions or those of others. This could leave others feeling badly when they don’t understand their emotions, feelings, or expressions.
                
                <br>
                Clearly, there are personal and professional benefits to improving your emotional intelligence. In Forbes, Co-Chair of Nobel Peace prize-nominated campaign and New York Times best-selling author Chade-Meng Tan addressed the benefits of improving emotional intelligence. 
                He pointed out that high emotional intelligence correlates with better work performance, makes people better leaders and creates the conditions for personal happiness. He stated, “There are also compelling personal benefits, and the most basic of those occur in three categories: calmness and clarity of mind, resilience and more satisfying relationships.”
                <br>
                <br>
                Emotional intelligence plays a role in overall success much like traditional intelligence. In fact, some researchers argue that it plays a bigger role. In his 1995 book “Emotional Intelligence: Why It Can Matter More Than IQ,” psychologist Daniel Goleman introduced the idea of an EQ. 
                Much like an IQ, an EQ is a measurement for individuals’ emotional intelligence aptitude. Goleman argues that EQ counts twice as much as IQ and technical skills combined when it comes to becoming successful.
                <br>
                <br>
                Whether or not that is true is certainly debatable, but emotional intelligence has served humans well throughout our evolution and history. It played a role long before it was officially defined, and likely will for years to come.
