            <p> In emotional psychology, emotions are split into two groups: basic and complex.
                Basic emotions are associated with recognizable facial expressions and tend to happen automatically.  <a href="#footer" class="word">Charles Darwin</a><sup>1</sup> was the first to suggest that emotion-induced facial expressions are universal. 
                This suggestion was a centerpiece idea to his theory of evolution, implying that emotions and their expressions were biological and adaptive. 
                In fact, emotions have been observed in animals by researchers for several years, suggesting that they’re pivotal to survival in other species as well. 
                Basic emotions are likely to have played a role in our survival throughout human evolution, signaling to those around us to react accordingly.
                Emotional psychologist <a href="#footer" class="word">Paul Ekman</a><sup>2</sup> identified six basic emotions that could be interpreted through facial expressions. They included happiness, sadness, fear, anger, surprise and disgust. 
                He expanded the list in 1999 to also include embarrassment, excitement, contempt, shame, pride, satisfaction and amusement, though those additions have not been widely adapted.
